# Data Structure Course

Welcome to the Data Structure Course repository. This repository contains coursework, projects, and special exercises related to data structures and algorithms.

## Directory Structure

### Projects

The `Projects` directory includes practical implementations and exercises:

#### AVL_Airline_Reservation_System

- **files/**: Contains data files used by the airline reservation system.
  - `Flights.txt`: Contains information about available flights.
  - `Reserves.txt`: Contains reservation records.
  - `Users.txt`: Contains user information.

- `Airline_Reservation_System.cpp`: Implementation of an airline reservation system using an AVL tree data structure. This system supports user registration, flight reservations, and administrative functions.
- `README.md`: Documentation detailing how to use the Airline Reservation System.

#### Sorting_Algorithms

- `Sorting_Algorithms.cpp`: Implementation of various sorting algorithms, including:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Heap Sort

  This file demonstrates the implementation and performance of these sorting algorithms.
- `README.md`: Documentation explaining the sorting algorithms implemented and how to run the code.

### Specials

The `Specials` directory contains additional programs for special topics and advanced data structures:

- `BFS.cpp`: Implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
- `Sparse_Matrix.cpp`: Implementation of operations for sparse matrices.
